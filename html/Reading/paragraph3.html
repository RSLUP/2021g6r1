  <p id="Head">New Fact Checking Website Arrives</p>
   <p id="Topic1">Read the text below and then answer questions 1-5 choosing in each case the answer <b>(A, B or C)</b> which fits best.</p>

   <HR style="width:80%;color:#800000;">
   
   
   <p id="Topic2">Africa Check, a fledgling fact checking website, is attempting to pin down unfounded claims made
      by the country's leaders, media outlets along with widely held beliefs.</p>
      <p id="Topic2">There is a common claim in Johannesburg that it has the largest man-made forest in the world.
         It's easy to believe; the city has lush, green canopy that covers many neighborhoods. But it's not true,
          according to Africa Check, which found that the largest man-made forest is actually in China, next to the
           Gobi desert.</p><p id="Topic2">Debunking bogus claims, politically charged fictions and unfounded statements, Africa
              Check is a website that challenges media, politicians and the occasional social media celebrity when they
              massage the truth, or ignore it completely, said Julian Rademeyer, southern Africa editor for the site.</p>
              <p id="Topic2">"I think the fundamental element of our work is that we are trying to get people to question 
                what they're told, what they read, what politicians say to them, and to look at what the information that is
                 there and ask essentially what the fundamental question is 'Where is the evidence?' If someone makes a 
                 claim, where is the evidence to support that claim, and to actually interrogate those claims and not to
                  accept things purely for what they are," Rademeyer said.</p><p id="Topic2">Africa Check was launched in 
                    June 2012 by the Agence France Press foundation in partnership with the University of Witswaterand's 
                    journalism department. Rademeyer and a researcher are the site's two full-time employees. There is 
                    also a team of freelance reporters who work on fact checking assignments.</p><p id="Topic2">Following
                       in the footsteps of popular American websites like PolitiFact and Factcheck.org, Africa Check is
                        the first media outlet in South Africa to solely work in fact checking. South Africa has a strong 
                        legacy of investigative journalism and photography that dates back to the apartheid era. But like
                         many countries, Rademeyer says its news industry has been hampered by shrinking budgets and
                          newsrooms.</p><p id="Topic2">"Because of the fact that newspapers don't have the resources
                             they would've had in the past, or don't have specialist beat reporters," he said. "It allows
                  public figures and it allows politicians to make claims that don't go checked. I think that's
                               where we play a role. We come in and look at those claims and we have the ability and the 
                time to go through those claims."</p><p id="Topic2">Paula Fray, former editor for the
                                  Star Newspaper and a media consultant, says Africa Check may put a much-needed pressure
                                   on newsrooms.</p><p id="Topic2">"At the moment Africa Check is not known as much as 
                                     I'm hoping as it going to be known," she said. "I'm hoping that eventually journalists
                      will be writing their stories and thinking if my news editor doesn't pick up that 
                                      something hasn't been verified, Africa Check might pick up that it hasn't been 
                         verified. So I'm not going to put anything in my stories unless I can prove it."</p>
                                      <p id="Topic2">She also hopes it will create a greater culture of accountability. 
                                        "I think the more organizations out there holding journalism to account the better 
                            actually for the industry," Fray said.</p><p id="Topic2">The site also takes on
                                           myths that get repeated so often that they go unchecked. When a South African
                                            musician with 175,000 Facebook followers made the claim that white South 
                                            Africans are being killed at an alarming rate, Africa Check looked into the 
                                            facts. It found that most of the musician's claims were exaggerated or 
                                            untrue.</p><p id="Topic2">The site has also debunked claims made about 
                                              traditional healers, South Africa's rate of asylum seekers and a BBC report 
                                              about white squatter camps in South Africa.</p><p id="Topic2">Long term, 
                                                Rademeyer envisions the site expanding across the continent. "I really do
                           think as a project it could play a very important role," he said. 
                                                 "We've done some very basic fact checking or fact sheet-related reporting 
                        on elements of the elections in Zimbabwe recently. We'd obviously like to 
             do more of that in the next elections in Zimbabwe, for instance, and elections in neighboring countries.
              And try to expand our reach." With presidential elections looming next year in South Africa, Botswana, 
              Mozambique and Namibia, the site will be busy.</p>
